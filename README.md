# Next + Netlify + TypeScript Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/89f6c73a-bfb3-4a15-8b99-36467ea37f3a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/next-netlify-typescript-starter/deploys)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Deployment on Netlify can be [configured](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/) using `netlify.toml`.

### Installation options

**Option one:** One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cagmz/next-netlify-typescript-starter)

1. Click this button, follow the Netlify prompts to allow access to your GitHub account, and allow it to create a clone of this repository on your account.
2. Clone the new repository in your GitHub account

**Option two:** Manual clone

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/cagmz/next-netlify-typescript-starter.git` 
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm run dev`
3. Make your changes
4. Connect to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)

## Getting Started

npm install
# or
